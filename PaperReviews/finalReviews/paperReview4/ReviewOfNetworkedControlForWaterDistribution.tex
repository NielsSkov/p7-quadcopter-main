\section*{Review of Paper on\\
Networked Control for Water Distribution\\
\small Wednesday, 30th of November 2016}
\subsection{Overall Assessment}
Very nice paper to read. Understandable and good flow of information. \\
There are a lot of grammatical errors, which needs to be looked into.  
\subsection{General Comments}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] Maybe the abstract should also contain the conclusion of the project, to give a full first impression of the project.
	\item[-]
There are different ways of implementing equations in the flow of the paper. However, we think that including the equations as part of the sentences provides a good flow. In this case, proper grammatical punctuation should be used around equations.\\

\end{figure}

Either way, we suggest to select one way and then stick to it as much as possible. Right now you change between using a colon and not using a colon. 
\item[-]Using "below" and "above" for figure and equation references can be confusing in a paper where the layout is in columns, we think that the figure reference itself is sufficient.
\end{itemize}	
\subsection{Specific Comments}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-]Abstract - 1st column - 1st paragraph - "Water Distribution networks are play a key infrastructure role for cities and industrial areas around the world."\\
Suggestion: "Around the world water distribution networks have a key role for cities and industrial areas infrastructure."\\
\item[-]Abstract - 1st column - 1st paragraph - "The nature of water distribution networks means the actuators, sensors and control systems are geographically separated [...]".\\
Suggestion: "in general water distribution networks have actuators, sensors and control systems geographically separated [...]".\\
\item[-]Section I - 1st column - 2nd paragraph - "[...] distribution networks (WDN) so all consumers [...]".\\
Suggestion: "[...] distribution networks (WDN) to ensure all consumers [...]".\\
\item[-] Section I - 1st column - 2nd paragraph - "Addition of users in a network [...]".\\
Suggestion: "In addition to the number of users in a network [...]".\\
\item[-]Section I - 1st column - 2nd paragraph - "[..] in whole distribution network [..]".\\
Suggestion: "[...] in the whole distribution network. [...]".\\
\item[-]Section I - 1st column - 2nd paragraph - "[...] according to consumer's need and components available in that network [...]".\\
Suggestion: "[...] according to  consumer's needs and the components available in the specific network [...]".\\
\item[-]Section I - 1st column - 2nd paragraph - "[...] desired operating pressure point via [...]".\\
Suggestion: "[...]desired pressure operating point by utilizing [...]".\\
\item[-]Section I - 1st column - 2nd paragraph - "The water distribution network has nonlinear characteristics [3]".\\
Suggestion: This sentence is slightly out of context, maybe including it in the Section II description underneath (3rd paragraph in section I), as a reason to linearize, would be better.\\
\item[-]Section I - 1st column - 3rd paragraph: " [...] and state space model is derived from linearized model [...]".\\
Suggestion: "[...] and "a" state space model is derived from "a" linearized model [...]".\\
\item[-]Section I - 1st and 2nd column - 3rd paragraph: "In section III [...]".\\
Suggestion: This should be on the same line and column.\\
\item[-]Section II A 1 - 2nd column - paragraph 2: "Includes the surface resistance and from resistance".\\
Thoughts: What is this "from resistance"?\\
\item[-]Thoughts on Section II A 1 - 2nd column - equation (1)\\
Note: It is hard to see that it is an absolute value of $q_k$. \\
Suggestions: separate the three variables by dots.\\
\item[-]Section II A 2 - 1st column - 3rd paragraph - "[...]in m$^3$/h [...]".\\
Suggestion: "[...] in [m$^3$/h][...]".\\
\item[-]Section II C - 2nd column - 2nd paragraph - Figure 1\\
Suggestion: Nice figure, maybe the three components can be in a row to take up less space.\\
\item[-]Section II C - 2nd column - 4th paragraph - "[...] component in the network and the components are in reference to Figure 1."\\
Suggestion: "[...] component in the network."\\
\item[-]Section II C - 1st and 2nd column - 4th paragraph - Figure 4\\
Thoughts: The figure is really nice. However it is quite small; maybe it could take up an entire page, if there is enough room for it.\\
\item[-]Section II C - 1st and 2nd column - 4th paragraph - Figure 4 - Figure text: "Test Water Distribution Network Diagram".\\
Suggestion: "Diagram of the water distribution network test setup."\\
\item[-]Section II C - 1st column - 6th paragraph - "[...] for the pipe, valve from [...]".\\
Suggestion: "[...] for the pipe and valve from [...]".\\
\item[-]Section II C - 1st column - 6th paragraph - "[...] are shown below. [enter] Thus, in matrix form, [...]".\\
Thoughts: You write like there are loop equations below (which there aren't). Then you use the non-existent equations in a state space model.\\
\item[-]Section III - 1st column - 3th paragraph - Figure 5: The label and title should be bigger. Furthermore a legend should be included.\\
\item[-]Section - 1st column - 4th paragraph - "Figure 5. above, the system's output [...]"\\
Suggestion: "In Fig. 5, the system's output [...]"\\
Thought: As it is referred to Fig. 5 in the figure, therefore it should be Fig. 5 in the text as well.\\
\item[-]Section IV - 1st column - 1st paragraph: "This introduced the delays from sensors to controlling part and also from controlling parts to actuators."\\
Suggestion: "This introduces delays from sensors to controllers and from controllers to actuators."\\
\item[-]Section IV - 1st column - 1st paragraph: "[...] delay is occurred in system by controllers, actuators and network controlling part exchanging data."\\
Suggestion: "[...] delay occurs when the different components of the system, the controller, actuators and sensors, are exchanging data."\\
Thoughts: Maybe we do not understand it correctly, in which case it should be written more clearly.\\
\item[-]Section IV - 1st column - 1st paragraph: "[...] compared to other."\\
Thoughts: Other?
