General Assessment:
It is not finished, and therefore an overall impression is hard to draw. However the language and tone is nice.

General commets:
Figure texts should not state “that it shows, …” , it should simply state ‘what is in the figure’. 
Do not start a sentence with a variable. Then write: the variable, X, is … 

Consistency with spacing between word and source. 


Specific comments:
Headline information: include your email adresses.
Leave out address of the department, that can easily be googled.

I-Introduction: Arrows missing on the figure

II.A- Physical System Description: Seta does not decide, the maximum overshoot is given/related by seta …


II.A - 
Model derivation should not lead to model with numbers - that should be in results we believe. Same goes for the simulation figure. It is still a result. 

Unless the focus is entirely on the control system, then one may argue, that model is method as a way of obtaining the control system, and therefore the model with values does not belong in results. However I disagree, as the group estimate parameters for the model themselves, making it a somewhat result. 

II.B. 
Name AND source? Jesper Viese Knudsen. Should it not be just the source? 


III. Controller:

Matrices must be fat ink or with an arrow above to indicate it is matrices. 
When mentioned in the text, it shall be in math mode to have it in italic
