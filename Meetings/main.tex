\section*{Supervisor meeting\\ \small Wednesday, 16th of November 2016}
\subsection{Paper}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Methods Section - We will write our modeling and our control approach in methods.
	\item Results Section - We will have simulation results in the draft and real and simulation results in the final paper.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Discussion about requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Normally you would only have functional requirements and overshoot or rise time is not important. Unless a specific requirement is important in the product. It is maybe not the best idea in our case as we are also doing the model and building the platform.
\end{itemize}	
\subsection{Exam Date}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We will set a date when the censor is known. Probably next Wednesday.
\end{itemize}
