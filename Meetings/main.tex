\subsection{Voltage Level Test}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] Battery test should be called voltage level test. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Inertia Test}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] We need to be careful with the length of the wires, maybe higher frequency is desired. 
	\item[-] If we get a ball or something with known inertia, then we can check if the test is accurate.
\end{itemize}
