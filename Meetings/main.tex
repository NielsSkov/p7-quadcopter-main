\section*{Supervisor meeting\\ \small Wednesday, 5th of October 2016}

\subsection{Tests}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] The thrust test has been done with a new setup, resulting in slightly different measurements.
  \item[-] The drag test has been done using the torque-meter, results seems okay.
  \item[-] The battery level test is yet to be done.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] Talk about the controller design with Christoffer.
  \item[-] When we change roll, the other to motors change the velocity a little bit. The disturbance is small and may originate from sign-error or from physical implications of the model.
  \item[-] To investigate the above, the two motors (that maybe should not change) can be turned off in the simulation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Observer}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] A reduced order observer has been designed to determine the angular velocities.
  \item[-] The Vicon system returns very good measurements, so an observer would not be needed, since the derivative of these angles would be sufficient.
  \item[-] It is not necessary when only using vicon, but for the learning perspective, it is nice to implement in the system.
  \item[-] The observer is especially relevant when using on-board sensors like a gyroscope, so designing it now will make the project flexible for later such implementation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Miscellaneous}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] To get an acceleration of \si{1 m/s^2} we need around \si{0.5 rad} - weather or not this is a large acceleration is difficult to say. It is not ridicules number.
  \item[-] We can compute the maximum acceleration from the mass and thrust force of the quadrotor.
  \item[-] When choosing the magnitude of acceleration we should take the angular disturbances into account.
\end{itemize}
