\section*{Supervisor meeting\\ \small Wednesday, 21st of September 2016}

\subsection{Modeling}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] The model looks fine for now, however we might discover some signerrors when we start doing control.
  \item[-] Drag force: $D = \frac{1}{2} \rho A V^2 C_D$, look it up on Wiki.
  \item[-] The drag is easy to model, just put it in with a negative sign in the velocity direction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] We can use an acknowledge-based communication, reason: Educational.
  \item[-] We will send position and angle information through the network.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Miscellaneous}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] Write down details on the scope of the project.
  \item[-] Get a blue box to keep stuff in the Vicon room.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Next Supervisor Meeting}
